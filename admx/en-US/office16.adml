      <string id="L_SpecifyIssuerFilterExplain">This policy setting allows you to configure Office to only allow certificates from a specific issuer when creating a digital signature.
      
If you enable this policy setting, Office only displays certificates that contain the string you set in the policy. This setting is case-sensitive.

For example, a setting of "MyCA" would match an issuer of "MyCA 1"and "MyCA 2", but not "MYCA 3".

If you disable or don’t configure this setting, then signing certificates from any issuer can be used.</string>
      <string id="L_SpecifyTimestampServerName">Specify timestamp server name</string>
      <string id="L_SpecifyTimestampServerNameExplain">This policy setting allows you to set the HTTP URL for the timestamp server used by Office 2016 applications in the process of validating messages or documents.

If you do disable or not configure this policy setting, a timestamp server will not be used.</string>
      <string id="L_SetTimestampServerTimeout">Set timestamp server timeout</string>
      <string id="L_SetTimestampServerTimeoutExplain">This policy setting allows you to configure the number of seconds Office 2016 applications wait for a response from the time stamping server before timing out.  If timeout occurs, the Office 2016 application will not open the message or document.

If you enable this policy setting, the number of seconds you specify will be the length of time Office 2016 will wait for the time stamping server to return a result.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the default of 5 seconds will be used.</string>
      <string id="L_SetSignatureVerificationLevel">Set signature verification level</string>
      <string id="L_SetSignatureVerificationLevelExplain">This policy setting allows you to set the verification level used by Office 2016 applications when validating a digital signature.

Note: Enabling this policy setting is not recommended for subscription versions of Office, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, because it will use the legacy registry based rules settings (described below) instead of basing the verification level on the Office version that signed the file.

If you enable this policy setting, you can set the verification level to any of the following:

- No rules: Office 2016 digital signature rules are disabled.

- Office 2007 rules: Office 2016 uses the Office 2007 digital signature rules.

- Office 2010 rules: Office 2016 uses the Office 2010 digital signature rules.

- Office 2013 rules: Office 2016 uses the Office 2013 digital signature rules.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, subscription versions of Office 2016 use the rules of the Office version that was used to sign the document to validate the digital signature.</string>

      <string id="L_RequestedXAdESLevelForSignatureGenerationExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify a requested or desired XAdES level in creating a digital signature. 

If you enable this policy setting, you may specify the XAdES level in creating a digital signature.  If the desired XAdES level is not reached, the last highest XAdES level reached is used if the level is higher than the minimum XAdES level (XAdeES-BES).

- No XAdES: XML-DSig - No XAdES
- XAdES-BES: Minimal XAdES (Default)
- XAdES-T: Will fall back to XAdES-BES if minimum XAdES level &lt; XAdes-T

If you enable this policy setting, the PDF encryption UI is hidden.  If your organization has a higher requirement on encryption than what is supported, the recommendation is to enable this policy setting.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the PDF encryption UI is shown, and users may choose to encrypt the PDF file or not.</string>
      <string id="L_SetMinimumPasswordLength">Set minimum password length</string>
      <string id="L_SetMinimumPasswordLengthExplain">This setting will define what the minimum length a password should be when the local policy is enforced.

If you enable this policy setting, you may specify the minimum password length.  The valid range is between 0 and 255.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the default minimum password length is 0 characters.</string>
      <string id="L_SetPasswordRulesLevel">Set password rules level</string>
      <string id="L_SetPasswordRulesLevelExplain">This policy setting allows you to set the password rules level.

If you enable this policy setting, you may specify a password rules level:

- No password checks: There are no complexity checks
- Local length check: Minimum length checks
- Local length and complexity checks: Minimum length checks plus 3 of 4 character groups checks.
- Local length, local complexity, and domain policy checks: All the previous checks plus Windows domain password rules enforced.

If you select "Local length and complexity checks" or "Local length, local complexity, and domain policy checks," then the password must contain characters from at least three of four character sets: lowercase a-z, uppercase A-Z, digits 0-9, or non-alphabetic characters.  When this complexity is enforced, the minimum password length needs to be at least 6, but can be more depending on the value set in the "Set minimum password length" policy setting.

If you select "Local length, local complexity, and domain policy checks," then Microsoft Office will use the Windows domain policy as well as all the settings "Local length and complexity checks."  This allows a custom password filter that is installed for Windows passwords to be used.  If you are offline or a domain controller cannot be contacted, then the Windows password settings are not used, and only the "Local length and complexity checks" settings are used.  If you don’t have a custom password filter, then "Local length and complexity checks" saves a trip across the network and would be the best choice.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the same as if this policy setting were enabled and "No password checks" selected.</string>

      <string id="L_DisableallTrustBarnotificationsforExplain">This policy setting controls whether Office 2016 applications notify users when potentially unsafe features or content are detected, or whether such features or content are silently disabled without notification. 

The Message Bar in Office 2016 applications is used to identify security issues, such as unsigned macros or potentially unsafe add-ins. When such issues are detected, the application disables the unsafe feature or content and displays the Message Bar at the top of the active window. The Message Bar informs the users about the nature of the security issue and, in some cases, provides the users with an option to enable the potentially unsafe feature or content, which could harm the user's computer. 

If you enable this policy setting, Office 2016 applications do not display information in the Message Bar about potentially unsafe content that has been detected or has automatically been blocked. 

If you disable this policy setting, Office 2016 applications display information in the Message Bar about content that has automatically been blocked. 

If you do not configure this policy setting, if an Office 2016 application detects a security issue, the Message Bar is displayed. However, this configuration can be modified by users in the Trust Center.</string>

      <string id="L_TurnOffCameraAndMicrophoneInApplicationGuard">Turn off camera and microphone access for Office apps using Application Guard.</string>
      <string id="L_TurnOffCameraAndMicrophoneInApplicationGuardExplain">The policy allows you to control whether Office apps using Application Guard can access the user's camera and microphone if they're enabled on the user's device.

Important: A compromised Application Guard container could bypass camera and microphone permissions and access the camera and microphone without the user’s knowledge. To prevent unauthorized access, we recommend that the camera and microphone be turned off on the user’s device when they aren’t needed.

If you enable this policy setting, Office apps using Application Guard won't be able to access the camera and microphone on the user’s device. 

If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, Office apps using Application Guard will be able to access the camera and microphone on the user’s device.

This policy setting only applies to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

If you enable this policy setting, you must choose from the following behaviors:

- Enable clipboard functionality between the host and Application Guard (default).
- Disable clipboard functionality completely between the host and Application Guard.
- Enable the clipboard to copy content from Application Guard to the host.
- Enable the clipboard to copy content from the host to Application Guard.

Note: Application Guard only allows copying text and images and doesn’t allow copying of rich content.
Important: We recommend that you don't enable copying from the host to Application Guard. If you enable this functionality, a potentially compromised Application Guard session will have access to the host device’s clipboard and its content.

You can also choose the type of content that can be copied, by using the content options:
- Allows text copying (default).
- Allows image copying.
- Allows both text and image copying.

If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, users can copy and paste content to and from documents opened in Application Guard to other locations outside Application Guard.

If you enable this policy setting, Office apps won't use Application Guard to isolate untrusted documents even if the device is configured to use Application Guard. Instead, Office will use Protected View to isolate untrusted documents.

Note: You should consider enabling this policy setting if you want to stop Office apps from using Application Guard without impacting the use of Application Guard with other applications.

If you disable or don't configure this policy settings, Office apps will use Application Guard to isolate untrusted documents. The device must be configured to use Application Guard and the user must be licensed to use Application Guard.</string>
      <string id="L_TurnOffHardwareAccelerationInApplicationGuard">Disable hardware acceleration for Office in Application Guard</string>
      <string id="L_TurnOffHardwareAccelerationInApplicationGuardExplain">This policy setting controls whether Office in Application Guard uses hardware or software acceleration to render graphics.

If you enable this setting, Application Guard uses software-based (CPU) rendering and won’t load any third-party graphics drivers or interact with any connected graphics hardware.

Important: Be aware that disabling or not configuring this policy setting with potentially compromised graphics devices or drivers might pose a risk to the user's device.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, Application Guard uses Hyper-V to access supported, high-security rendering graphics hardware (GPUs). These GPUs improve rendering performance and battery life while using Application Guard, particularly for video playback and other graphics-intensive operations. If you disable or don't configure this setting without connecting any high-security rendering graphics hardware, Application Guard will automatically revert to software-based (CPU) rendering.

      <string id="L_ConfigurePreCreateInApplicationGuardExplain">This policy setting determines if the Application Guard container, for isolating untrusted files, is pre-created for improved run time performance.

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the number of days to continue pre-creating an Application Guard container if the user has not opened a file with Application Guard. Pre-creating a container when the user logs in will decrease the wait time when opening an untrusted file.

“65535” will configure Office to always create an Application Guard container when a user logs into Windows.
"20" will configure Office to pre-create the container each time a user logs into Windows for up to 20 days after the last time the user opened an untrusted file using Application Guard.
“0” will configure Office to never pre-create the container. Instead the container will only be created when a user opens their first untrusted file after logging into Windows.

Note: if you configure Office to never pre-create a container then users will experience a longer wait when opening an untrusted file after logging into Windows.

If you disable or don’t configure this setting, Office will use a built-in heuristic to pre-create the container.

      <string id="L_SupressOfficesigningProviders">Suppress Office Signing Providers</string>
      <string id="L_SupressOfficesigningProvidersExplain">This policy setting controls whether users can apply a default Microsoft Office signature line to Word documents and Excel workbooks. Digital signatures provide assurances of authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation to electronic documents. In Excel and Word, users can add visible representations of their signatures to a document at the same time that they add digital signatures. The ability to capture digital signatures by using signature lines in Office 2016 documents makes it possible for organizations to use paperless signing processes for documents such as contracts or other agreements. 

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for enabling the default Microsoft Office 2016 signature lines: 

- Enable Western and East Asian - Both Microsoft Office Signature Line and Stamp Signature Line are available from the Signature Line drop-down menu on the Insert tab of the Ribbon. 

- Suppress default Western -  Users cannot add the Microsoft Office Signature Line to documents. 

- Suppress default East Asian - Users cannot add the Stamp Signature Line to documents. 

- Suppress both Western and East Asian. Neither of the default signature lines is available. This only takes affect if there is at least one other valid third party signature provider installed. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Excel and Word include support for two kinds of signature lines, called Microsoft Office Signature Line and Stamp Signature Lines. The choice(s) available to the user vary according to the editing language(s) that are configured for the application at installation. 

- Microsoft Office Signature Line displays the letter "X" followed by a horizontal line, a familiar convention for handwritten signature lines. 

- Stamp Signature Line is only available to users of the Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, or Korean language versions of Office 2016, or to users who have installed Office 2016 Multi-Language Pack for one of these languages. This signature line displays a square, a convention in countries where rubber identity stamps (called hanko in Japan and South Korea) are used to sign documents. 

Both kinds of signature lines allow signers to specify their name, title, and e-mail address. If neither kind of signature line is appropriate, third-party signature products can be added to Office applications to serve different needs. 

If the correct signature line is not available for users to choose, they might be prevented from digitally signing documents. 

Note -  This policy setting only applies to visible signature lines in Excel workbooks and Word documents. It does not affect the ability of users to add invisible digital signatures to Excel workbooks, PowerPoint presentations, and Word documents.</string>

If you enable this policy setting, Office 2016 applications use the Office 2003 binary format to apply digital signatures to Office 97-2003 binary documents so that they will be recognized by the Office 2003 release and earlier applications. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Office 2016 applications use the XML--based XMLDSIG format to attach digital signatures to documents, including Office 97-2003 binary documents. XMLDSIG signatures are not recognized by Office 2003 applications or previous versions. If an Office 2003 user opens an Excel, PowerPoint, or Word binary document with an XMLDSIG signature attached, the signature will be lost.</string>
      <string id="L_EKUfiltering">EKU filtering</string>
      <string id="L_EKUfilteringExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify enhanced key usage (EKU) values to be used in filtering a list of digital certificates for signing Excel, PowerPoint, and Word documents. An enhanced key usage (EKU) extension to a digital certificate is a collection of one or more values that indicate how a certificate should be used. Examples of EKU values include Smart Card Logon and Client Authentication. EKU filtering allows you to filter the list of installed certificates that can be used for digitally signing documents. The filtered list will appear when users attempt to select a certificate for digitally signing a document. 

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify a list of object identifiers (OIDs) that represent acceptable EKUs for certificates used in conjunction with signed documents. For example, for a certificate with the Encrypting File System (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.4) identifier, the OID is 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.4. This list of appropriate OIDs will vary according to the specific certificates that the organization uses.  For a list of object IDs associated with Microsoft cryptography, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 287547, "Object IDs associated with Microsoft cryptography" at http://officeredir.microsoft.com/r/rlidGPOIDAndCrypt2O14?clid=1033.

      <string id="L_LoadControlsinForms3">Load Controls in Forms3</string>
      <string id="L_LoadControlsinForms3Explain">This policy setting allows you to control how ActiveX controls in UserForms should be initialized based upon whether they are Safe For Initialization (SFI) or Unsafefor Initialization (UFI). 
 
 ActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects and have unrestricted access to users' computers. ActiveX controls can access the local file system and change the registry settings of the operating system. If a malicious user repurposes an ActiveX control to take over a user's computer, the effect could be significant. To help improve security, ActiveX developers can mark controls as Safe For Initialization (SFI), which means that the developer states that the controls are safe to open and run and not capable of causing harm to any computers. If a control is not marked SFI, the control could adversely affect a computer--or it's possible the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether their control might be compromised at some future date.SFI controls run in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a worksheet control can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only read from files when it is in safe mode. This functionality allows the control to be used in very powerful ways when safety wasn't important, but the control would still be safe for use in a Web page. If a control is not marked as SFI, it is marked Unsafe For Initialization (UFI), which means that it is capable of affecting a user's computer. If UFI ActiveX controls are loaded, they are always loaded in unsafe mode. 
 
 If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for loading controls in UserForms: 
 
 1- For a UFI or SFI signed control that supports safe and unsafe mode, load the control in unsafe mode. For an SFI signed control that only supports a safe mode configuration, load the control in safe mode. This option enforces the default configuration. 
 
 2 - Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt, loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI: 
 
 - For a UFI signed control, if users respond Yes to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond No, load the control using the default properties. 
 
 - For an SFI signed control that supports both safe and unsafe modes, if users respond Yes to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond No, load the control using safe mode. If the SFI control can only support safe mode, load the control in safe mode. This option is the default configuration in the Microsoft Office 2016 release. 
 
 3 - Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt, loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI: 
 
 - For a UFI signed control, if users respond Yes to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond No, load the control with its default properties. 
 
 - For an SFI signed control, load in safe mode. 
 
 4 - For a UFI signed control, load with the default properties of the control. For an SFI signed control, load in safe mode (considered to be the safest mode). 
 
 If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is as if you enable this policy setting and then select option 1.  </string>

      <string id="L_CheckedChoosestheoptionYesIamwillingtoparticipateanonymously">This policy setting controls whether users can participate in the Microsoft Office Customer Experience Improvement Program to help improve Microsoft Office. When users choose to participate in the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP), Office 2016 applications automatically send information to Microsoft about how the applications are used. This information is combined with other CEIP data to help Microsoft solve problems and to improve the products and features customers use most often. This feature does not collect users' names, addresses, or any other identifying information except the IP address that is used to send the data. 

If you enable this policy setting, users have the opportunity to opt into participation in the CEIP the first time they run an Office application. If your organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as the CEIP, allowing users to opt in to the program might cause them to violate these policies. 

If you disable this policy setting, Office 2016 users cannot participate in the Customer Experience Improvement Program. 

If you do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of setting the policy to "Enabled".</string>
      <string id="L_CheckedDisablestheloadingofXMLexpansionpackswithaSmartDocume">This policy setting controls whether Office 2016 applications can load an XML expansion pack manifest file with a Smart Document. 

An XML expansion pack is the group of files that constitutes a Smart Document in Excel and Word. You package one or more components that provide the logic needed for a Smart Document by using an XML expansion pack. These components can include any type of file, including XML schemas, Extensible Stylesheet Language Transforms (XSLTs), dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), and image files, as well as additional XML files, HTML files, Word files, Excel files, and text files. 

The key component to building an XML expansion pack is creating an XML expansion pack manifest file. By creating this file, you specify the locations of all files that make up the XML expansion pack, as well as information that instructs Office 2016 how to set up the files for your Smart Document. The XML expansion pack can also contain information about how to set up some files, such as how to install and register a COM object required by the XML expansion pack. 

If you enable this policy setting, Office 2016 applications cannot load XML expansion packs with Smart Documents. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Office 2016 applications can load an XML expansion pack manifest file with a Smart Document.</string>

If you enable this policy setting, users will opt into sending personal information to Office. If your organization has policies that govern the use of external resources, opting users into the program might cause them to violate these policies.

      <string id="L_SendTelemetryExplain">This policy setting allows you to configure the level of client software diagnostic data that is collected and sent to Microsoft about the Office client software running on the user's device.

Client software diagnostic data is used to keep Office secure and up-to-date, detect, diagnose and remediate problems, and also make product improvements. This data does not include a user's name or email address, the content of the user's files, or information about apps unrelated to Office.

If you enable this policy setting, you must choose which level of diagnostic data is sent to Microsoft. Your choices are Required, Optional, or Neither.

If you choose Required, the minimum data needed to keep Office secure, up-to-date, and performing as expected on the device it's installed on is sent to Microsoft.

If you choose Optional, additional data that helps make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help detect, diagnose, and remediate issues is sent to Microsoft. If you choose to send optional diagnostic data, required diagnostic data is also included.

If you choose Neither, no diagnostic data about Office client software running on the user's device is sent to Microsoft. This option, however, significantly limits Microsoft's ability to detect, diagnose, and remediate problems that your users may encounter when using Office.

If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, optional diagnostic data is sent to Microsoft.

      <string id="L_ActiveXControlInitialization">ActiveX Control Initialization</string>
      <string id="L_ActiveXControlInitializationExplain">This policy setting specifies the Microsoft ActiveX® initialization security level for all Microsoft Office applications. ActiveX controls can adversely affect a computer directly. In addition, malicious code can be used to compromise an ActiveX control and attack a computer. To indicate the safety of an ActiveX control, developers can denote them as Safe For Initialization (SFI). SFI indicates that a control is safe to open and run, and that it is not capable of causing a problem for any computer, regardless of whether it has persisted data values or not. If a control is not marked SFI, it is possible that the control could adversely affect a computer--or it could mean that the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether it might be compromised in the future. 
 
 If you enable this policy setting, you can set the ActiveX security level to a number between 1 and 6. These security levels are as follows: 
 
 1 - Regardless of how the control is marked, load it and use the persisted values (if any). This setting does not prompt the user. 
 
 2 - If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, load in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or use the default (first-time initialization) settings. This level is similar to the default configuration, but does not prompt the user. 
 
 3 - If SFI, load the control in unsafe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with default (first-time initialization) settings. 
 
 4 - If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with default (first-time initialization) settings. 
 
 5 - If SFI, load the control in unsafe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with persisted values.  
 
 6 - If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with persisted values. 
 
 If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, if a control is marked SFI, the application loads the control in safe mode and uses persisted values (if any). If the control is not marked SFI, the application loads the control in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or uses the default (first-time initialization) settings. In both situations, the Message Bar informs users that the controls have been disabled and prompts them to respond. 
 
 Important - Some ActiveX controls do not respect the safe mode registry setting, and therefore might load persisted data even though you configure this setting to instruct the control to use safe mode. This setting only increases security for ActiveX controls that are accurately marked as SFI. In situations that involve malicious or poorly designed code, an ActiveX control might be inaccurately marked as SFI.</string>

If you enable this policy setting, you may specify the number of minutes for the refresh interval.  This limit prevents cache subscriptions from being refreshed more frequently, reducing the number of requests issued against the line-of-business (LOB) system.

      <string id="L_QueryTimeout">Set query processing timeout limit</string>
      <string id="L_QueryTimeoutExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify the maximum number of minutes the system will spend processing an individual query.  When the interval is exceeded, the processing is aborted and the query is marked as failed.  The query will then be retried later.  Several bulk operations (especially queries) can take a significant amount of time before all results are retrieved and processed.  During this time no other operation can be processed.

If you enable this policy setting, you may specify the maximum number of minutes the system will spend processing an individual query.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, a default value of 20 minutes will be used.</string>
      <string id="L_QueryInstancesLimit">Set query items limit</string>
      <string id="L_QueryInstancesLimitExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify the maximum number of items that will be added to the client’s cache as the result of executing a query.  Several bulk operations (especially queries) can return a large number of items to be added to the cache. This increases the size of the cache, potentially exceeding the 4GB limit imposed by Microsoft SQL Server CE. It also increases the amount of work required to keep the cache synchronized and increases the load on the LOB server. In order to protect the system, a limit is used – any results processed before reaching the limit are still committed, but the operation is marked as failed and will be retried later.

If you enable this policy setting, you may specify the maximum number of items that will be added to the client’s cache as the result of executing a query.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, a default value of 2000 items will be used.</string>
      <string id="L_CleanupInterval">Set the cleanup interval</string>
      <string id="L_CleanupIntervalExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify the interval (in minutes) for how long successfully completed operations and other data that is no longer needed will remain in the cache before they can be deleted.  The synchronization process leads to data in the cache that will no longer be needed.  However, the data may be useful for troubleshooting purposes.  To prevent the cache from growing too large, the cache contents should periodically be deleted.

If you enable this policy setting, you may specify the interval (in minutes) for the times the contents in the cache are deleted.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, a default value of 1440 minutes (1 day) will be used.</string>
      <string id="L_ErrorsCleanupInterval">Set errors cleanup interval</string>
      <string id="L_ErrorsCleanupIntervalExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify the interval for how long failed operations and other error data will remain in the cache before they can be deleted.  Synchronization can fail for any reason.  The failed operations and related instances are marked as "in error," and this data will eventually need to be removed from the cache.  It is recommended that this interval be larger than the regular cleanup interval to give the user opportunities to troubleshoot errors.

If you enable this policy setting, you may specify the interval (in minutes) for the times the failed operations and error data in the cache are deleted.    

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, a default value of 10080 minutes (1 week) will be used.</string>

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify one of the following for the update location:  a network share, a folder on the local computer where Office is installed, or an HTTP address. Mapped network drives aren’t supported. 

If you enable this policy setting, but you leave the update location blank, Office will get updates from the Internet.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, Office will get updates from the Internet, unless you specify a different location by using the Office Deployment Tool.

Important: This policy setting only applies to Office products that are installed by using Click-to-Run. It doesn't apply to Office products that use Windows Installer (MSI).</string>
      <string id="L_UpdateTargetVersion">Target Version</string>

If you enable this policy setting, you specify the version that you want to update Office to. The next time Office looks for updates, Office will try to update to that version. The version must be available where Office is configured to look for updates (for example, on a network share). 

If you enable this policy setting, but you leave the version blank, Office is updated to the most current version that’s available at the update location for Office.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, Office is updated to the most current version that’s available at the update location for Office, unless you specify a different version by using the Office Deployment Tool.

Important:  This policy setting only applies to Office products that are installed by using Click-to-Run. It doesn't apply to Office products that use Windows Installer (MSI).</string>

      <string id="L_PreventBingInstall">Don’t install a background service for Microsoft Search in Bing</string>
      <string id="L_PreventBingInstallExplain">This policy setting controls whether a background service for Microsoft Search in Bing gets installed. The background service is included when you first install Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise or when you update to a new version.

This background service checks the status of a check box in the Microsoft Search section of the Microsoft 365 admin center. If the check box is selected, a Microsoft Search in Bing extension for Google Chrome is installed. The extension sets the default search engine to Bing, but users can change the default search engine even after the extension is installed.

Note: The check box in the Microsoft 365 admin center isn’t selected by default. Therefore, even if the background service is installed, your users won’t see any changes unless you go into the Microsoft 365 admin center and select the check box.

If you enable this policy setting, the background service won’t be installed. Since the background service isn’t installed, the extension won’t be installed, even if the check box in the Microsoft 365 admin center is selected.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, the background service will be installed. Even if the background service is installed, the extension won’t be installed unless the check box in the Microsoft 365 admin center is selected.

      </string>
      <string id="L_UpdateBranch">Update Channel</string>
      <string id="L_UpdateBranchExplain">This policy setting controls which update channel Office gets updates from.

If you enable this policy setting, Office gets updates from the update channel that you select.

If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, Office gets updates from its default channel, or by the update channel specified by the Office Deployment Tool. The default channel is determined by which Office product that is installed.

Note: This policy setting only applies to subscription versions of Office, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, and to subscription versions of Project and Visio.​</string>
      <string id="L_UpdateDeadline">Update Deadline</string>
      <string id="L_UpdateDeadlineExplain">This policy setting allows you to set a deadline by when updates to Office must be applied.

You can set a deadline in one of two ways:

    Specify a date and time

    Specify a certain number of days after the update has been downloaded

Prior to the deadline, users will receive multiple reminders to install the updates. If Office isn't updated by the deadline, the updates are applied automatically. If any Office programs are open, they'll be closed, which might result in data loss.

If you're specifying a date and time, we recommend that you set the deadline at least a week in the future to allow users time to install the updates.

If you enable this policy setting, you need to either specify a date and time or specify a certain number of days.

Note: This policy setting only applies to Office products that are installed by using Click-to-Run. It doesn't apply to Office products that use Windows Installer (MSI).</string>
      <string id="L_DeferUpdateDays">Delay downloading and installing updates for Office</string>
      <string id="L_DeferUpdateDaysExplain">This policy setting allows you to delay downloading and installing updates for Office by a specified number of days.

Note: This policy setting won’t apply if you are using some methods to manage updates. For example, if you use Group Policy to specify a target version. Also, updates won’t be delayed if you are switching Office to a different update channel.

If you enable this policy setting, Office will delay downloading and applying updates by the number of days specified. The maximum value that you can specify is 14. If you specify 0, Office will download and apply updates as soon as Office detects that updates are available.

Note: If you have also specified a deadline for updates to be installed, the deadline won't be considered until after the delay that you specify with this policy setting.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, Office will download and apply updates as soon as Office detects that updates are available.

Note: This policy setting only applies to subscription versions of Office, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, and to subscription versions of Project and Visio.</string>
      <string id="L_VLtoSubscription">Upgrade Office 2019 to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise</string>
      <string id="L_VLtoSubscriptionExplain">This policy setting allows you to upgrade volume licensed versions of Office Professional Plus 2019 to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.

Note: For the user to be able to use Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, you must have purchased an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 plan that includes Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, and you must have assigned the user a license to use Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.

If you enable this policy setting, the installed volume licensed version of Office 2019 on the user's computer will be upgraded to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.  We also recommend that you use Group Policy to specify an update path and an update channel for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.

Note: If there are volume licensed versions of Visio and Project on the user's computer, those won't be upgraded to subscription versions of Visio and Project.

If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, Office 2019 isn't automatically upgraded to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. But, you can initiate the upgrade by using some other method, such as by using the Office Deployment Tool.</string>
      <string id="L_UpdateBlockVersion">Prevent Office from being updated to a specific version</string>
      <string id="L_UpdateBlockVersionExplain">This policy setting allows you to prevent Office from being updated to a specific version, and instead have Office be updated to a different version that you specify.

If you enable this policy setting, you need to specify both the version to block and the version to update Office to. You list the version to block first and separate the two versions with a colon. You can specify more than one version to block by separating the entries with a vertical bar.

For example, if you want to block versions 16.0.10326.10000 and 16.0.10326.20000 and have Office updated to version 16.0.10328.10000 instead, you would enter 16.0.10326.10000:16.0.10328.10000|16.0.10326.20000:16.0.10328.10000.

If the blocked version is already installed, Office will be updated to the other version you've specified.

Note: if you make a mistake entering the versions, the update won't be blocked. Also, be sure that the installation files for the version that you want to update Office to are available on the update location.

If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, Office will be updated to whichever more current version is available in the location where Office is configured to get updates from, unless youve specified a version to block by using the Office Deployment Tool.

Note: This policy setting only applies to Office products that are installed by using Click-to-Run. It doesn't apply to Office products that use Windows Installer (MSI).</string>
      <string id="L_HideUpdateNotifications">Hide Update Notifications</string>
      <string id="L_HideUpdateNotificationsExplain">This policy setting allows you to hide notifications to users that updates to Office are available.

When automatic updates are enabled for Office, in most cases updates are applied automatically in the background without any user input. However, updates can’t be applied if an Office program is open. If an Office program is open, other attempts are made to apply the updates at a later time. If, after several days, updates haven’t been applied, only then will users see a notification that an update to Office is available.

If you enable this policy setting, users won’t see notifications that updates to Office are ready to be applied.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, users will see notifications that updates to Office are ready to be applied.

This policy setting does not apply to notifications associated with update deadlines.

Important:  This policy setting only applies to Office products that are installed by using Click-to-Run. It doesn't apply to Office products that use Windows Installer (MSI).</string>
      <string id="L_OfficeMgmtCOM">Management of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise</string>
      <string id="L_OfficeMgmtCOMExplain">This policy setting enables programmatic control of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.

If you enable this policy setting, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager or other application management solutions can manage Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. After applying the policy setting, you need to restart the Office Click-to-Run service. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the Configuration Manager update workflow will not be able to manage Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. You will, however, be able to continue to use the Office Deployment Tool and Configuration Manager’s program and packages or applications deployment methods. 

Note: This policy setting also applies to subscription versions of Project and Visio, which also are installed by using Click-to-Run.</string>
      <string id="L_SetBITSasPrimary">Prioritize BITS</string>
      <string id="L_SetBITSasPrimaryExplain">This policy setting prioritizes the use of Windows Background Interface Transfer Service (BITS) by the Office client when downloading Office updates from the Office Content Delivery Network (CDN).

If enabled, BITS will be used on devices that are downloading Office updates directly from the Office CDN and throttle values used by BITS will be honored. The device will not leverage BITS if updates are obtained from a local UNC share.

If disable or not configured, BITS will not be prioritized and http will be the primary transport for downloading updates.

Note: This policy setting only applies to subscription versions of Office, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, and to subscription versions of Project and Visio.​</string>
      <string id="L_OnlineRepair">Online Repair</string>
      <string id="L_OnlineRepairExplain">
This policy setting controls whether users can run an online repair for an Office client, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, that comes with an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 plan. You can also control whether the online repair only uses a local source and doesn't use the Office Content Delivery Network (CDN) on the Internet.

Note: Users must have administrative privileges on the local computer to run an online repair.

If you enable or don't configure this policy setting, users can run an online repair from "Programs and Features" or "Add/Remove Programs" in Control Panel.

The online repair downloads and reinstalls Office from the Office CDN or from a local source, such a network share, depending on how Office is configured to get updates. If you aren't using the Office CDN, the local source must contain all the required files, including language files, to perform the repair.

Select "Use Office CDN (if needed)" if you want to use the Office CDN as an alternative location for the repair if the local source isn't available or doesn't contain all the necessary files.

You can also use a local copy of the Office Deployment Tool (setup.exe) for the repair by entering a local path for the Office Deployment Tool. This path can be a network share. If setup.exe can't be found in the local path specified, and "Use Office CDN (if needed)" is selected, then the online repair downloads a copy of setup.exe from the Office CDN. Otherwise, the online repair will fail.

The repair maintains all configuration settings, including products, languages, excluded applications, and update settings.

If you disable this policy setting, users can't run an online repair, but they can still run a quick repair.

Note: This policy setting only applies to subscription versions of Office, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, and to subscription versions of Project and Visio.</string>

      <string id="L_TrustLegacySignature">Trust legacy VBA signatures</string>
      <string id="L_TrustLegacySignatureExplain">This policy setting allows you to control how Office loads and verifies legacy Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) signatures.

If you enable or do not configure this policy setting, Office applications can load and verify legacy VBA signatures.

If you disable this policy setting, Office applications can’t load or verify legacy VBA signatures. They can only load and verify agile VBA signatures.</string>
      <string id="L_MinSigSupportOS">Set the minimum operating system for verifying agile VBA signatures</string>
      <string id="L_MinSigSupportOSExplain">This policy setting allows you to set the minimum operating system (OS) on which agile VBA signatures produced by Office can be verified. This ensures the hashing algorithm used to sign is compatible with the specified OS and later versions. 

If you enable this policy setting, Office uses the OS you specify as the minimum OS to verify agile VBA signatures.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Office uses Windows 7 as the minimum OS to verify agile VBA signatures.

If you specify a minimum OS version that is higher than the highest OS supported by Office, Office uses the highest supported OS to verify agile VBA signatures.</string>

        If you enable this policy setting, Office document versions from the server that have been locally cached for more than n days, will be deleted from the local cache.

        If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, Office document versions from the server that have been locally cached, will be deleted from the local cache if older than the default of one day.</string>
      <string id="L_OnlineStorageFilter">Hide Microsoft cloud-based file locations in the Backstage view</string>
      <string id="L_OnlineStorageFilterExplain">This policy setting allows you to hide Microsoft cloud-based file locations in the Backstage view in Office. This helps prevent users from opening, saving, or sharing cloud-based files to locations such as: OneDrive, SharePoint, or Third Party Services.

This policy setting only applies to Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.

To filter specific services, add the values for all services to be disabled:
    1 - OneDrive Personal

Shared computer activation is used only for situations where multiple users share the same computer. For example, when using Remote Desktop Services (RDS). 

By default, the licensing token used by shared computer activation is saved in the %localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Licensing folder. But, this location isn’t included in the user’s roaming profile, so the licensing token won’t be available if the user signs in to a different computer.

If you enable this policy setting, you need to specify a location to store the licensing token used by shared computer activation.  You should specify a folder that is specific to the user and that will be available to the user from whatever computer on the network that the user signs in to. For example, a folder that’s included in the user’s roaming profile, or a shared folder on the network, where there is a folder for each user.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, Office uses the default folder to save the licensing token used by shared computer activation.

Legacy translation features include the following:
- Translation of the entire document, by using the browser-based Bilingual Viewer.
- Translation of selected text, by using the Research pane.
- Translation of an individual word when hovering over the word, by using the Mini Translator.

You may need to use legacy translation features in special cases that require extra configurability, such as when using customer translation providers.

By default, a hyperlink to a file stored in one of these locations opens the file in the Office client version of Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. This is the version of Office that is installed on the user’s computer. If Office isn’t installed on the user’s computer, the file is opened in the Office Online version of the program in the user’s web browser.

If you enable this policy setting, a hyperlink to an Office file stored in one of these locations opens the file in the Office Online version of Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. This opens the file in the user’s web browser.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, a hyperlink to an Office file stored in one of these locations opens the file in the Office client version of Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, if Office is installed on the user’s computer.

By default, checked-out files are stored in the Office Document Cache. The Office Document Cache allows the same offline editing capabilities as a local folder, but automatically syncs the files when there is Internet connectivity.

Note: It’s not recommended to enable this policy setting unless needed to support existing document management processes.

If you enable this policy setting, users can specify a local folder to save checked-out files to by going to File &gt; Options &gt; Save &gt; Offline editing options.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, checked-out files are stored in the Office Document Cache.</string>
      <string id="L_MacroRuntimeScanScope">Macro Runtime Scan Scope</string>
      <string id="L_MacroRuntimeScanScopeExplain">This policy setting specifies the behavior for both the VBA and Excel 4.0 (XLM) runtime scan features. Multiple Office apps support VBA macros, but XLM macros are only supported by Excel. Macros can only be scanned if the anti-virus software registers as an Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) provider on the device.

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from the following options to determine the macro runtime scanning behavior:

- Disable for all files (not recommended): If you choose this option, no runtime scanning of enabled macros will be performed.

- Enable for low trust files: If you choose this option, runtime scanning will be enabled for all files for which macros are enabled, except for the following files:
      - Files opened while macro security settings are set to “Enable All Macros”
      - Files opened from a Trusted Location
      - Files that are Trusted Documents
      - Files that contain VBA that is digitally signed by a Trusted Publisher

- Enable for all files: If you choose this option, then low trust files are not excluded from runtime scanning.

The VBA and XLM runtimes report to an antivirus system certain high-risk code behaviors the macro is about to execute. This allows the antivirus system to indicate whether or not the macro behavior is malicious. If the behavior is determined to be malicious, the Office application closes the session and the antivirus system can quarantine the file. If the behavior is non-malicious, the macro execution proceeds.

Note: When macro runtime scanning is enabled, the runtime performance of affected VBA projects and XLM sheets may be reduced.

If you disable this policy setting, no runtime scanning of enabled macros will be performed.

If you don’t configure this policy setting, “Enable for low trust files” will be the default setting.

Note: This policy setting only applies to subscription versions of Office, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.</string>

      <string id="L_OfficeReadinessToolkitCustomTags">Specify custom labels to use with the Readiness Toolkit</string>
      <string id="L_OfficeReadinessToolkitCustomTagsExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify up to four custom labels to categorize and filter data in reports created by the Readiness Toolkit for Office. Labels are available in reports that are based on scans of the most recently used Office documents and installed add-ins on the user’s computer.

You can specify any string for the custom labels. For example, you can use a label to indicate the user’s department, title, or geographic location. When the Readiness Toolkit runs on the user’s computer, the custom labels are collected and are made available in the reports that are created. For example, you can filter the report to show only data from the Finance Department. Assign labels in a consistent manner, such as always using Label 1 for department.

If you enable this policy setting, the custom labels that you specify will be available in reports created by the Readiness Toolkit.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, custom labels won’t be available in reports created by the Readiness Toolkit.

Note: If you're using the Office Telemetry Dashboard and have already configured tags (labels), the Readiness Toolkit automatically collects those labels during its scan of the user's computer and will make them available in its reports. You don't need to enable this policy setting unless you want to specify different labels. Labels you specify for the Readiness Toolkit won't appear in the Office Telemetry Dashboard.</string>

      <string id="L_MinimizeVbaResigning">Enable Minimizing VBA Project Digital Signature Invalidation</string>
      <string id="L_MinimizeVbaResigningExplain">This policy setting allows you to reduce the number of actions in Office that will result in a document's VBA digital signature becoming invalidated.

The VBA project may be modified in certain ways that change the project storage but that do not invalidate the source code digital signature. With this setting turned off, these actions will lead to the VBA digital signature being invalidated, and the signature dropped on save if the user does not have the private key available to resign.

With this setting on, we will only perform a resign of the project if the source code signature has changed, and will keep the existing signature in other cases. If the VBA project storage is changed and saved, but the old signature retained under this feature, this can lead to an invalidation of the saved compiled VBA project state. If this happens, the VBA project will be forced to recompile each time the document is loaded. This may have negative performance impacts for larger VBA projects. Once a document is in this state, the state will persist until the VBA project is resigned.</string>

If you enable this policy setting, the option for Microsoft 365 Insider is shown under File &gt; Account.

Note: if you enable this policy setting, you shouldn’t enable and configure the “Update Channel” or the “Update Path” policy setting under Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Microsoft Office 2016 (Machine)\Updates.

      <string id="L_AuthenticationFBABehaviorExplain">This policy setting controls how Office applications handle form-based sign-in prompts.​

If you enable this policy setting, you must choose one of the following options:​

Block all prompts​
Ask the user what to do for each new host​
Show prompts only from allowed hosts​

If you select “Block all prompts” then no form-based sign-in prompts are shown to the user and the user is shown a message that the sign-in method isn’t allowed.​

If you select “Ask the user what do for each new host” then the user is asked for each new host whether the user wants to sign-in to the host. If the user has previously signed-in to a host, a form-based sign-in prompt is shown for that host. Also, form-based sign-in prompts are shown for any hosts specified by the “Specify hosts allowed to show form-based sign-in prompts to users” setting.

If you select “Show prompts only from allowed hosts” then form-based sign-in prompts are shown only from hosts that have been specified by the additional “Specify hosts allowed to show form-based sign-in prompts to users” setting. Form-based sign-in prompts from all other hosts are blocked and the user is shown a message that the sign-in method isn’t allowed.

Note: If you don’t configure the “Specify hosts allowed to show form-based sign-in prompts to users” setting or don’t specify any hosts in that setting, then the behavior of the “Show prompts only from allowed hosts” option will be the same as if you selected the “Block all prompts” option.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, all form-based sign-in prompts are blocked and the  user is shown a message that the sign-in method isn’t allowed. But users are able to change the behavior for form-based sign-in prompts by going to File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Form-based sign-in.

      <string id="L_AllowVbaIntranetRefsExplain">This policy setting permits VBA to load typelib references by explicit path read from the project data if that path points to an intranet location that is not explicitly in the system trusted sites list.

By default, VBA will attempt to load typelibs referenced in a project by searching for the library GUID in the registry. If it is not found in the registry, VBA will attempt to load the typelib or project reference using the path stored in the project for the reference as long as the reference does not point to an internet or intranet location that is not in the trusted sites list.

If you enable this policy setting, VBA will treat intranet paths like local machine paths, and therefore VBA will attempt to search for unregistered references in intranet locations that are not local machine or in the system's trusted sites list.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, VBA maintains its default behavior and will refuse to load typelibs on intranet paths if it does not find the typelib registered in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.

      <string id="L_DisableStrictVbaRefsSecurityPolicy">Disable additional security checks on VBA library references that may refer to unsafe locations on the local machine</string>
      <string id="L_DisableStrictVbaRefsSecurityPolicyExplain">This policy setting restricts VBA to checking project library references only against the registry and trusted zones. By default VBA performs additional checks against library paths to prevent loading references from potentially unsafe locations on the local machine as well. It is recommended that this setting remain 0 or unset to allow for the more secure default behavior. Only enable this setting if the default behavior is causing compatibility issues with critical solutions, and then, only to provide time to migrate the solutions to address the less secure behavior, at which point the setting should be turned off again.

If you enable this policy setting, Office will occasionally notify end-users if they are eligible to purchase an Office subscription for their personal use at a discount via the Microsoft Workplace Discount Program. End-users can permanently opt-out of these notifications at any time using a button within the notification.

If you disable this policy setting, Office will not display any notifications related to the Microsoft Workplace Discount Program.

If you don't configure this policy setting, Microsoft will control whether or not these notifications appear. Please check the Message Center in the Microsoft 365 admin center for updates on whether this feature has been enabled by Microsoft yet and the default setting for the notifications.

For more information about update channels, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=846105.

If you enable this policy setting, the Update Channel option is shown under File &gt; Account. You need to select which update channels will be shown as options to the user.

Important:
- Users must be a local administrator on the device to change to a different update channel.
- Beta Channel is not a supported update channel. It should only be used in test environments and by a small group of select users, such as IT staff or application developers.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, the Update Channel option is not shown under File &gt; Account.

Notes:
- This policy setting only applies to subscription versions of Office, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, and to subscription versions of Project and Visio.

If you enable this policy setting, you must choose one of the following options:
Disabled
Enable upload of diagnostics logs to Microsoft
Enable the collection of diagnostic logs in an archive

If you select "Disabled", Office applications will not display a visible Get Diagnostics button in the Help Ribbon.

If you select "Enable upload of diagnostics logs to Microsoft", Office applications will have a visible Get Diagnostics button in the Help Ribbon. Clicking this button will upload the application’s diagnostic logs to Microsoft for support purposes.

If you select "Enable the collection of diagnostic logs in an archive", Office applications will have a visible Get Diagnostics button in the Help Ribbon. Clicking this button will capture the application’s diagnostic logs in a file archive on the device where the application is currently running. These logs will not be uploaded to Microsoft.

Please note that the option “Enable the collection of diagnostic logs in an archive” may not be applicable in certain Office applications. When the application does not support local log collection, setting the policy to this option will completely disable the feature, removing the "Get Diagnostics" button.

If you don’t set this policy, the feature will operate in the default mode, which is “Enable upload of diagnostics logs to Microsoft.”

      <string id="L_externalConverterAsDefaultForFileExtensionPPTExplain">This policy setting allows you to enable an external file format converter as the default for a particular file extension on a computer.  To set this policy you need to specify the file extension (e.g. "odp") for Value Name and the external file format converter via the converter's classname (e.g. "TestConverter") for Value.

If you enable this policy setting for a particular file extension, the file format converter specified for that extension is used as the default converter for loading the files.

If you do not configure this policy setting for a particular file extension, Microsoft PowerPoint processes files with that extension in an application defined manner.

Note: This policy can only be specified once per file extension.</string>

      <string id="L_BlockMacroExecutionFromInternet">Block macros from running in Office files from the internet</string>
      <string id="L_BlockMacroExecutionFromInternetExplain">
        This policy setting allows you to block macros from running in Office files that come from the internet.

        If you enable this policy setting, macros are blocked from running, even if "Enable all macros" is selected in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. Users will receive a notification that macros are blocked from running.

        The exceptions when macros will be allowed to run are:
        - The Office file is saved to a Trusted Location.
        - The Office file was previously trusted by the user.
        - Macros are digitally signed and the matching Trusted Publisher certificate is installed on the device.

        If you disable this policy setting, the settings configured in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center determine whether macros run in Office files that come from the internet.

        If you don’t configure this policy setting, macros will be blocked from running. Users will receive a notification telling them of the security risks of macros from the internet along with a link to learn more.

      <string id="L_DisableTrustBarNotificationforunsignedExplain">This policy setting controls whether the specified Office application notifies users when unsigned application add-ins are loaded or silently disable such add-ins without notification. This policy setting only applies if you enable the "Require that application add-ins are signed by Trusted Publisher" policy setting, which prevents users from changing this policy setting.

If you enable this policy setting, applications automatically disable unsigned add-ins without informing users.
 
If you disable this policy setting, if this application is configured to require that all add-ins be signed by a trusted publisher, any unsigned add-ins the application loads will be disabled and the application will display the Trust Bar at the top of the active window. The Trust Bar contains a message that informs users about the unsigned add-in.

If you do not configure this policy setting, the disable behavior applies, and in addition, users can configure this requirement themselves in the "Add-ins" category of the Trust Center for the application.</string>
      <string id="L_DisableTrustBarNotificationforunsigned">Disable Trust Bar Notification for unsigned application add-ins and block them</string>
      <string id="L_RequirethatApplicationExtensionsaresignedExplain">This policy setting controls whether add-ins for this applications must be digitally signed by a trusted publisher.
 
If you enable this policy setting, this application checks the digital signature for each add-in before loading it. If an add-in does not have a digital signature, or if the signature did not come from a trusted publisher, this application disables the add-in and notifies the user. Certificates must be added to the Trusted Publishers list if you require that all add-ins be signed by a trusted publisher. For detail on about obtaining and distributing certificates, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294922. Office 2016 stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store.  Office 2016 still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store. Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Office and you upgrade to Office 2016, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. For more information about trusted publishers, see the Office Resource Kit.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, this application does not check the digital signature on application add-ins before opening them. If a dangerous add-in is loaded, it could harm users' computers or compromise data security.</string>

If you enable this policy setting, all add-ins for the specified Office 2016 applications are disabled.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, all add-ins for the specified Office 2016 applications are allowed to run without notifying the users.</string>
      <string id="L_TrustedLocationsExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify a location that is used as a trusted source for opening files in this application.  Files in trusted locations bypass file validation, active content checks and Protected View. Macros and code in these files will execute without displaying warnings to the user. If you change or add a location make sure that the new location is secured, with only appropriate user permissions to add document/files.

If you enable this policy setting, you may specify a folder location, path, and date from which files can the application can open files which run macros without warning.  If you check the "Allow sub folders" check box, then all sub-folders in the folder you specify will also be trusted.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the trusted location is not specified.</string>

      <string id="L_AllowTrustedLocationsOnTheNetwork">Allow Trusted Locations on the network</string>
      <string id="L_AllowTrustedLocationsOnTheNetworkExplain">This policy setting controls whether trusted locations on the network can be used.

If you enable this policy setting, users can specify trusted locations on network shares or in other remote locations that are not under their direct control by clicking the "Add new location" button in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission.

If you disable this policy setting, the selected application ignores any network locations listed in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. 

If you also deploy Trusted Locations via Group Policy, you should verify whether any of them are remote locations. If any of them are remote locations and you do not allow remote locations via this policy setting, those policy keys that point to remote locations will be ignored on client computers.

Disabling this policy setting does not delete any network locations from the Trusted Locations list, but causes disruption for users who add network locations to the Trusted Locations list. Users are also prevented from adding new network locations to the Trusted Locations list in the Trust Center.  We recommended that you do not enable this policy setting (as the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box also states). Therefore, in practice, it should be possible to disable this policy setting in most situations without causing significant usability issues for most users.

If you do not enable this policy setting, users can select the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box if desired and then specify trusted locations by clicking the "Add new location" button.</string>
      <string id="L_DisableTrustedLoc">Disable all trusted locations</string>
      <string id="L_DisableTrustedLocExplain">This policy setting allows administrators to disable all trusted locations in the specified applications. Trusted locations specified in the Trust Center are used to define file locations that are assumed to be safe. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with a minimal amount of security, without prompting the users for permission. If a dangerous file is opened from a trusted location, it will not be subject to standard security measures and could harm users' computers or data.
      
If you enable this policy setting, all trusted locations (those specified in the Trust Center) in the specified applications are ignored, including any trusted locations established by Office 2016 during setup, deployed to users using Group Policy, or added by users themselves.  Users will be prompted again when opening files from trusted locations.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, all trusted locations (those specified in the Trust Center) in the specified applications are assumed to be safe.</string>
      <string id="L_TurnOffTrustedDocuments">Turn off trusted documents</string>
      <string id="L_TurnOffTrustedDocumentsExplain">This policy setting allows you to turn off the trusted documents feature.  The trusted documents feature allows users to always enable active content in documents such as macros, ActiveX controls, data connections, etc. so that they are not prompted the next time they open the documents.  Trusted documents are exempt from security notifications.

If you enable this policy setting, you will turn off the trusted documents feature.  Users will receive a security prompt every time a document containing active content is opened.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, documents will be trusted when users enable content for a document, and users will not receive a security prompt.</string>
      <string id="L_SetMaximumNumberOfTrustedDocuments">Set maximum number of trusted documents</string>
      <string id="L_SetMaximumNumberOfTrustedDocumentsExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify the maximum number of trust records for trusted documents that can be stored in the registry before the purge task runs. The purge task reduces the number of trusted documents stored in the registry to the value set by the "Set maximum number of trust records to preserve" policy setting.

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the maximum number of trusted documents to be stored in the registry before the purge task runs, with an upper limit of 20,000 documents. For performance reasons, we do not recommend setting this policy setting to the upper limit.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the default value of 500 is used for the maximum number of trusted documents that can be stored in the registry before the purge task runs.</string>
      <string id="L_SetMaximumNumberOfTrustRecordsToPreserve">Set maximum number of trust records to preserve</string>
      <string id="L_SetMaximumNumberOfTrustRecordsToPreserveExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify the maximum number of trust records to preserve when the purge task detects that this application has trusted more than the number of trusted documents set by the "Set maximum number of trusted documents" policy setting.

If you enable this policy setting, you may specify the maximum number of trust records to preserve, with an upper limit of 20000.  Due to performance reasons, it is not recommended to set it to the upper limit.

If you disable or you do not configure this policy setting, the default value for of 400 is used.</string>
      <string id="L_VBAWarningsPolicy">VBA Macro Notification Settings</string>
      <string id="L_VBAWarningsExplain">This policy setting controls how the specified applications warn users when Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros are present.

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about macros:
 
- Disable all with notification:  The application displays the Trust Bar for all macros, whether signed or unsigned. This option enforces the default configuration in Office.
 
- Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified.
 
- Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users.
 
- Enable all macros (not recommended):  All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected.
 
If you disable this policy setting, "Disable all with notification" will be the default setting.
 
If you do not configure this policy setting, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking "Enable Content" on the Trust Bar.  If the user clicks "Enable Content", then the document is added as a trusted document.
 
If you select “Disable all except digitally signed macros” we recommend that you also select the “Require macros to be signed by a trusted publisher” check box to help improve security.

If you select the “Require macros to be signed by a trusted publisher” check box, users opening files with digitally signed macros but not by a Trusted Publisher will receive a notification that macros are blocked from running. And there are two additional check boxes that we recommend that you select to help improve security.

- Block certificates from trusted publishers that are installed in the current user certificate store

- Require Extended Key Usage (EKU) for certificates from trusted publishers

Note: These two check boxes only apply if you have selected the "Require macros to be signed by a trusted publisher" check box.

Note: All three check boxes only apply to Version 2012 and later of Office and Visio. They don’t apply to Office 2016 or Office 2019.

If you select the “Block certificates from trusted publishers that are installed in the local machine certificate store” check box, macros won’t run if the certificate from the trusted publisher is installed in the current user certificate store. The certificate must be installed in the local machine certificate store for the macro to run. Only accounts with administrator access to the computer can install a certificate in the local machine certificate store.

If you select the “Require Extended Key Usage (EKU) for certificates from trusted publishers” check box, the EKU must include “Code Signing” as one of the uses of the certificate.

Important: If "Disable all except digitally signed macros" is selected, users will not be able to open unsigned Access databases.
 
Also, note that Microsoft Office stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Microsoft Office still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store.
 
Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Microsoft Office and you upgrade to Office, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store.</string>

To block add-ins that are not managed by this policy setting, you must also configure the "Block all unmanaged add-ins" policy setting.

To enable this policy setting, provide the following information for each add-in:

In "Value name," specify the programmatic identifier (ProgID) for COM add-ins, or specify the file name of PowerPoint add-ins.

To obtain the ProgID for an add-in, use Registry Editor on the client computer where the add-in is installed to locate key names under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\PowerPoint\Addins or HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\PowerPoint\Addins.

To obtain the file name of an add-in, click the File menu in the application where the add-in is installed. Click Options, click Add-ins, and then use the Location column to determine the file name of the add-in.

You can also obtain the ProgID or the file name of an add-in by using Office Telemetry Dashboard.

In "Value," specify the value as follows:

To specify that an add-in is always disabled (blocked), type 0.

To specify that an add-in is always enabled, type 1.

To specify that an add-in is configurable by the user and not blocked by the "Block all unmanaged add-ins" policy setting when enabled, type 2.

      <string id="L_DisableIncrementalDownload">Wait to show users a cloud-based presentation until all content is downloaded</string>
      <string id="L_DisableIncrementalDownloadExplain">
This policy setting allows you to control whether PowerPoint waits until all content is downloaded before showing a presentation to the user. This policy setting applies to presentations that are opened from a cloud-based location, such as OneDrive Personal, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint Online.

By default, when the user opens a cloud-based presentation in PowerPoint, the user can view the presentation while other content, such as images or video, continues to download. But, some functionality, such as editing and presenting, is limited or not available until the entire contents of the presentation are downloaded.

If you enable this policy setting, PowerPoint will wait, when opening a cloud-based presentation, until the entire contents of the presentation are downloaded before showing the presentation to the user.

You may want to enable this policy setting if you have add-ins or automated processes that rely on the entire contents of the presentation being available and fully editable as soon as the presentation is shown.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, PowerPoint opens cloud-based files more quickly, so the user can start viewing the presentation while the other content downloads.

Note: This policy setting only applies to subscription versions of Office, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.

If you enable this policy setting, when a user adds comments to a new file or a file without comments, the new comments that are added will be modern comments. If users have a version of PowerPoint that doesn’t support modern comments, a notification appears directing them to use PowerPoint for the web to view modern comments in files that have them.

If you disable this policy setting, users will continue to see the previous commenting experience for new files and existing files that do not have any modern comments. Users will still be able to read files that already have modern comments in them if they have a version of PowerPoint that supports modern comments.

For information about what happens when you don't configure this policy setting, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2116065.

If you enable this policy setting, you may select one of these choices:
-  CTRL+Enter is not a shortcut for sending a message
-  CTRL+Enter is a shortcut for sending a message
-  CTRL+Enter displays a prompt

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can use CTRL+ENTER to send an e-mail message.  By default, users are prompted the first time they use the shortcut to confirm sending the message.</string><string id="L_DisableExchangeConsumerAccountsDisplay">Prevent personal Microsoft accounts from using MAPI</string><string id="L_DisableExchangeConsumerAccountsExplain">This policy setting governs whether personal Microsoft accounts can be configured to use MAPI in Outlook.

A personal Microsoft account is an account hosted on Outlook.com, Hotmail.com, Live.com, Msn.com or any variation on those domains.

If you enable this policy, users won’t be able to configure a personal Microsoft account to use MAPI in Outlook.

This means that in the Add Account dialog box in Outlook, users must choose “Manual setup or additional server types,” then choose Next, and then choose “POP or IMAP.”

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, users can configure a personal Microsoft account to use MAPI in Outlook. They can do this by choosing “E-mail” account in the Add Account dialog box.

Note that personal Microsoft accounts that are configured to use MAPI will be automatically configured to use Cached Exchange Mode, and this can’t be changed.</string><string id="L_DisableFileArchive">Disable File|Archive</string><string id="L_DisableFileArchiveExplain">This setting allows you to disable File|Archive and prevent users from manually archiving items in their mailbox.  You might want to set this if you have deployed other messaging records management policies in order to avoid conflicts.  You should also consider disabling AutoArchive in the setting named AutoArchive Settings.</string><string id="L_ArchiveIgnoreLastModifiedTime">Change the criteria that Outlook uses to archive different item types</string><string id="L_ArchiveIgnoreLastModifiedTimeExplain">If you enable this policy setting, Outlook ignores the last modified date and archives items based on a date that is specific for the item type, as follows:

-Email message: The received date.
-Calendar item: The actual date that an appointment, event, or meeting is scheduled for.
-Task: The completion date. Tasks that are not marked as completed are not archived. Tasks that are assigned to other users are archived only if the status is completed. 
-Note: The last modified date and time.
-Journal entry: The date when the journal entry is created.
-Contact: Not archived.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook archives different items based on the item type, as follows:

-Email message: The received date or the last modified date and time, whichever is later. 
-Calendar item: The last modified date and time or the actual date that an appointment, event, or meeting is scheduled for, whichever is later. 
-Task: The completion date or the last modified date and time, whichever is later. Tasks that are not marked as completed are not archived. Tasks that are assigned to other users are archived only if the status is completed. 
-Note: The last modified date and time.
-Journal entry: The date when the journal entry is created or the last modified date and time, whichever is later.
-Contact: Not archived.</string><string id="L_Specifythevirtualkeycodeandmodifierfortheshortcutkeytodisabl">Specify the virtual key code and modifier for the shortcut key to disable.</string><string id="L_Alwayswarn">Always warn</string><string id="L_Neverwarndisableall">Never warn, disable all</string><string id="L_Warnforsigneddisableunsigned">Warn for signed, disable unsigned</string><string id="L_NoSecuritycheck">No security check</string><string id="L_SynchronizeOutlookRSSFeedswithCommonFeedList">Synchronize Outlook RSS Feeds with Common Feed List</string><string id="L_SynchronizeOutlookRSSFeedswithCommonFeedListExplain">This policy setting controls whether Outlook subscribes to the Common Feed List, which is made available to multiple RSS clients. The Common Feed List is a hierarchical set of RSS Feeds to which clients such as Outlook, the Feeds list in Internet Explorer 7, and the Feed Headlines Sidebar gadget in Windows Vista can subscribe. 

If you enable this policy setting, Outlook automatically subscribes to RSS Feeds added in Internet Explorer, and Outlook RSS Feeds are synchronized with the Common Feed List so they are available in Internet Explorer. Be aware that third-party applications besides Internet Explorer can add RSS Feeds to the Common Feed List, and if you enable this setting Outlook automatically subscribes to those RSS Feeds as well. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook maintains its own list of RSS Feeds and does not automatically subscribe to RSS Feeds that are added to the Common Feed List.</string><string id="L_DetermineOrderOfSourcesForPhotos">Determine order of sources for photos</string><string id="L_DetermineOrderOfSourcesForPhotosExplain">This policy setting controls the order of sources for photos displayed in Outlook.  

If you enable this policy setting, Outlook will first look at the OAB/AD for the user photo.  If this is not available, Outlook will show a Contact photo if the Contact photo is available.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will first look into the Contact Address Books for the user photo.  If this is not available, Outlook will look to the OAB/AD if available.</string><string id="L_TurnOffContactExport">Turn off contact export</string><string id="L_TurnOffContactExportExplain">This policy setting controls the ability of users to export contact information from the address book.

If you enable this policy setting, the "Add to Contacts" menu is not configurable in the address book.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the "Add to Contacts" menu is configurable.</string><string id="L_ShowContactslinkingcontrolsonallFormsExplain">By default, Tasks, Appointments, Journal Entries, and Contacts hide the controls in the Outlook user interface used for linking related contacts. When you enable this setting, the linking controls appear in Outlook. You might choose to enable this setting if your users rely on contact linking - for example, to track partners who attend appointments together or to track ways in which contacts are related to each other.</string><string id="L_ShowContactslinkingcontrolsonallForms">Show Contacts linking controls on all Forms</string><string id="L_ChineseSimplifiedGB18030">Chinese Simplified (GB18030)</string><string id="L_AllowsallActiveXControls">Allows all ActiveX Controls</string><string id="L_LoadonlyOutlookControls">Load only Outlook Controls</string><string id="L_AllowsonlySafeControls">Allows only Safe Controls</string><string id="L_TrustCenter">Trust Center</string><string id="L_TrustedListsOnly">Trusted Lists Only</string><string id="L_AttachmentSecureTemporaryFolderExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify a folder path for the Secure Temporary Files folder rather than using the one that is randomly generated by Outlook. 

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify a folder path for the Security Temporary Files folder rather than using the one that is randomly generated by Outlook. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will assign the Secure Temporary Files folder a different random name for each user. 

Important - If you must use a specific folder for Outlook attachments, Microsoft recommends that you use a local directory (for best performance), that you place the folder under the Temporary Internet Files folder (to benefit from the enhanced security on that folder), and that the folder name is unique and difficult to guess.</string><string id="L_OfflineAddressBook">Offline Address Book</string><string id="L_SecurityLevelOutlook">Security setting for macros</string><string id="L_SecutityLevelOutlookExplain">This policy setting controls the security level for macros in Outlook. 

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for handling macros in Outlook: 

- Always warn. This option corresponds to the "Notifications for all macros" option in the "Macro Settings" section of the Outlook Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from a trusted location, even if the macros are signed by a trusted publisher. For each disabled macro, Outlook displays a security alert dialog box with information about the macro and its digital signature (if present), and allows users to enable the macro or leave it disabled. 

- Never warn, disable all. This option corresponds to the "Disable all macros without notification" option in the Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from trusted locations, and does not notify users. 

- Warning for signed, disable unsigned. This option corresponds to the "Notifications for digitally signed macros, all other macros disabled" option in the Trust Center. Outlook handles macros as follows: 

--If a macro is digitally signed by a trusted publisher, the macro can run if the user has already trusted the publisher. 

--If a macro has a valid signature from a publisher that the user has not trusted, the security alert dialog box for the macro lets the user choose whether to enable the macro for the current session, disable the macro for the current session, or to add the publisher to the Trusted Publishers list so that it will run without prompting the user in the future. 

--If a macro does not have a valid signature, Outlook disables it without prompting the user, unless it is opened from a trusted location. 

This option is the default configuration in Outlook. 

- No security check. This option corresponds to the "Enable all macros (not recommended; potentially dangerous code can run)" option in the Trust Center. Outlook runs all macros without prompting users. This configuration makes users' computers vulnerable to potentially malicious code and is not recommended. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of Enabled -- Warning for signed, disable unsigned.</string><string id="L_ChangelimitMIMEbody">Change the limit for the number of MIME body parts</string><string id="L_ChangelimitMIMEbodyExplain">By default, the limit is 250 for the number of MIME body parts when an e-mail message is converted from MIME to MAPI. The number can be set to any positive integer. This helps prevent scenarios in which Outlook hangs while attempting conversion.</string><string id="L_ChangethelimitMIMEheaders">Change the limit for the number of MIME headers</string><string id="L_ChangethelimitMIMEheadersExplain">By default, the limit is 20000 for the number of MIME headers when an e-mail message is converted from MIME to MAPI.

You can change this behavior so that Safe Controls (Microsoft Forms 2.0 controls and the Outlook Recipient and Body controls) are allowed in one-off forms, or so that all ActiveX controls are allowed to run.</string><string id="L_Applymacrosecuritysettings">Apply macro security settings to macros, add-ins and additional actions</string><string id="L_BydefaultOutlookdoesnotusethemacrosecurity">This policy setting controls whether Outlook also applies the macro security settings to installed COM add-ins and additional actions. 

If you enable this policy setting, the macro security settings will also be applied to add-ins and additional actions. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook does not use the macro security settings to determine whether to run macros, installed COM add-ins, and additional actions.</string><string id="L_RetrievingCRLsCertificateRevocationListsExplain">This policy setting controls how Outlook retrieves Certificate Revocation Lists to verify the validity of certificates.Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are lists of digital certificates that have been revoked by their controlling certificate authorities (CAs), typically because the certificates were issued improperly or their associated private keys were compromised. 

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three options to govern how Outlook uses CRLs: 

- Use system Default. Outlook relies on the CRL download schedule that is configured for the operating system. 
- When online always retrieve the CRL. This option is the default configuration in Outlook. 
- Never retrieve the CRL. Outlook will not attempt to download the CRL for a certificate, even if it is online. This option can reduce security. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when Outlook handles a certificate that includes a URL from which a CRL can be downloaded, Outlook will retrieve the CRL from the provided URL if Outlook is online.</string><string id="L_OptionsExplain">You can use these settings to specify how tracking options work for Outlook e-mail messages.</string><string id="L_MessagehandlingExplain">You can use this setting to specify various options for how e-mail messages are handled.</string><string id="L_DoNotSendMeetingForwardNotifications">Do not send meeting forward notifications</string><string id="L_DoNotSendMeetingForwardNotificationsExplain">This policy setting prevents Outlook from sending meeting forward notifications.  This does not affect whether or not Exchange sends meeting forward notifications.  

If you enable this policy setting, Outlook will not send meeting forward notifications.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will send meeting forward notifications.</string><string id="L_UpgradeOnlyTheDefaultStore">Upgrade only the default store</string><string id="L_UpgradeOnlyTheDefaultStoreExplain">This policy setting allows you to specify that only the default data file is upgraded on the first boot of Outlook.

If you enable this policy setting, only the data file associated with your delivery mailbox is upgraded.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, all Outlook Data Files are upgraded.</string><string id="L_PreventusersfromaddingpstsExplain">By default, users can add PSTs to their Outlook profiles and can use Sharing-Exclusive PSTs for storing SharePoint Lists and Internet Calendars. You can use this setting to limit users' ability to store mail in a decentralized fashion. You can block the use of PSTs completely, but be aware that blocking all PSTs disables Outlook features such as SharePoint Lists and Internet Calendar. 

If instead you allow only Sharing-Exclusive PSTs to be added to user profiles, PST usage is still limited but the Outlook features that rely on special PSTs are not disabled. The setting that allows Sharing-Exclusive PSTs to be added blocks users from creating new folders in the Sharing-Exclusive PST; copying existing mail folders from their default store to the PST; and copying individual mail items to the root of the PST.</string><string id="L_Preventusersfromaddingpsts">Prevent users from adding PSTs to Outlook profiles and/or prevent using Sharing-Exclusive PSTs</string><string id="L_Defaultpstscanbeadded">(default) PSTs can be added</string><string id="L_Nopstscanbeadded">No PSTs can be added</string><string id="L_onlysharingexclusivepstscanbeadded">Only Sharing-Exclusive PSTs can be added</string><string id="L_15minutesdefault">15 minutes (default)</string><string id="L_20minutes">20 minutes</string><string id="L_25minutes">25 minutes</string><string id="L_30minutes">30 minutes</string><string id="L_35minutes">35 minutes</string><string id="L_40minutes">40 minutes</string><string id="L_45minutes">45 minutes</string><string id="L_50minutes">50 minutes</string><string id="L_1hour">1 hour</string><string id="L_2hours">2 hours</string><string id="L_4hours">4 hours</string><string id="L_8hours">8 hours</string><string id="L_24hours">24 hours</string><string id="L_PollingOOFWebsrvice">Polling Out-of-office Web service</string><string id="L_ModifynumberofchangeditemsincludedExplain">By default, the number of changes an Outlook client downloads from a SharePoint server in a single web service request or "page" is 250 changed items. If SharePoint servers have reduced capacity or are overwhelmed by the size of requests coming from Outlook clients, you can change this setting to specify a different number of items to download for a SharePoint page. 

You should test changes in this setting to determine the impact in your specific environment. A page size below 15 or above 1000 is not recommended.</string><string id="L_Modifynumberofchangeditemsincluded">Modify number of changed items included in SharePoint client page download</string><string id="L_AllowSelectionFloatiesExplain">Disabling this policy setting will result in Mini Toolbar not being displayed on text selection. By default, Mini Toolbar on selection is enabled and its visibility can be changed via a setting in the Editor Options dialog box.</string><string id="L_AutomaticallyConfigureProfileBasedOnActiveExplain">This policy setting controls whether a user’s Active Directory Primary SMTP address is automatically used when any new profile is created.

If you enable this policy setting, when a user creates any new profile, the user’s Active Directory Primary SMTP address is used for the profile. The user can only enter a profile name. The wizard used to configure specific profile settings is not shown to the user as the profile is created.

Note: If you want only the first new profile to use the Active Directory Primary SMTP address, and allow the user to specify a different SMTP address when creating other profiles, then use the “Automatically configure profile based on Active Directory Primary SMTP address (one-time only)” policy setting instead.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, when a user creates a new profile, the wizard used to configure specific profile settings is shown to the user and the user can specify any SMTP address as the profile is created.</string><string id="L_AutomaticallyConfigureProfileBasedOnActiveOnceExplain">This policy setting controls whether a user can create additional profiles and specify a different SMTP address, after the first profile is automatically created using the user’s Active Directory Primary SMTP address.

If you enable this policy setting, the first time a user creates a new profile, the user’s Active Directory Primary SMTP address is used for the profile. The user can only enter a profile name. The wizard used to configure specific profile settings is not shown to the user as the profile is created.

After the first profile is created automatically, the user can manually create additional profiles. The wizard used to configure specific profile settings is shown to the user and the user can specify any SMTP address as the profile is created.

Note: If you want the user’s Active Directory Primary SMTP address to always be used when creating a new profile, then use the “Automatically configure profile based on Active Directory Primary SMTP address” policy setting instead. If that policy setting is enabled, then it takes precedence over this policy setting.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, when a user creates a new profile, the wizard used to configure specific profile settings is shown to the user and the user can specify any SMTP address as the profile is created.</string><string id="L_AutomaticallyConfigureProfileBasedOnActive">Automatically configure profile based on Active Directory Primary SMTP address</string><string id="L_AutomaticallyConfigureProfileBasedOnActiveOnce">Automatically configure profile based on Active Directory Primary SMTP address (one-time only)</string><string id="L_PreventCopyingOrMovingItemsBetweenAccounts">Prevent copying or moving items between accounts</string><string id="L_PreventCopyingOrMovingItemsBetweenAccountsExplain">This policy setting allows you to prevent items from being copied or moved to other accounts or PSTs.

For example, say this option is set to 45. User A opens User B's calendar in Outlook, and then does not click on it again for 45 days. Outlook stops synchronizing the data with Exchange and the calendar is no longer up-to-date. The local copy of the data is removed from the OST file.

If you enable or disable this policy setting, calendars that are published on Office.com must have restricted access (users other than the calendar owner/publisher who wish to view the calendar can only do so if they receive invitations from the calendar owner), and users cannot publish their calendars to third-party DAV servers. 

If you do not configure this policy setting, users can share their calendars with others by publishing them to the Office.com Calendar Sharing Services and to a server that supports the World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol. Office.com allows users to choose whether to restrict access to their calendars to people they invite, or allow unrestricted access to anyone who knows the URL to reach the calendar.

This policy setting applies if you are using Outlook Anywhere (RPC over HTTP) to connect to a Microsoft Exchange Server. There are two Outlook profile settings on the Microsoft Exchange Proxy Settings dialog box (accessed through the Control Panel or Account Settings), that configure the default connection transport fallback behavior.
 
- On fast networks, connect using HTTP first, then connect using TCP/IP
- On slow networks, connect using HTTP first, then connect using TCP/IP
 
For example, if you are on a fast network and you enable the “On fast networks, connect using HTTP first, then connect using TCP/IP” setting in the Microsoft Exchange Proxy Settings dialog box, Outlook first attempts to connect to the Exchange Server using HTTP. If Outlook is unable to connect using HTTP, then it attempts to connect using TCP/IP.
 
If you enable this policy setting, if Outlook connection attempts with Microsoft Exchange Server fail, Outlook does not fallback to the TCP/IP protocol, regardless of what is specified in the Microsoft Exchange Proxy Settings dialog box. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook connection attempts with Microsoft Exchange Server can fallback from either TCP/IP to HTTP, or HTTP to TCP/IP, depending on the settings specified in the Microsoft Exchange Proxy Settings dialog box.

If you enable this policy setting, you may specify the URLs in the format: feed://&lt;subscription URL&gt;, where "feed://" replaces "http://".  This ensures that the URL is parsed as an RSS XML file in Outlook.

Note -  In previous versions of Outlook, when security settings were published in a form in Exchange Server public folders, users who needed these settings required the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Security\CheckAdminSettings registry key to be set on their computers for the settings to apply. In Outlook, the CheckAdminSettings registry key is no longer used to determine users' security settings. Instead, the Outlook Security Mode setting can be used to determine whether Outlook security should be controlled directly by Group Policy, by the security form from the Outlook Security Settings Public Folder, or by the settings on users' own computers.</string><string id="L_UseOutlookSecurityPolicy">Use Outlook Security Group Policy</string><string id="L_UseSecurityFormfromOutlook10">Use Security Form from 'Outlook 10 Security Settings' Public Folder</string><string id="L_UseSecurityFormfromOutlookSecuritySeetings">Use Security Form from 'Outlook Security Settings' Public Folder</string><string id="L_OutlookDefaultSecurity">Outlook Default Security</string><string id="L_OutlookSecurityPolicy">Outlook Security Policy:</string><string id="L_OutlookSecurityMode">Outlook Security Mode</string><string id="L_MiscAttachmentSettings">Attachment Security</string><string id="L_Level1AddFilePolicy">Add file extensions to block as Level 1</string><string id="L_Level1RemoveFilePolicy">Remove file extensions blocked as Level 1</string><string id="L_Level1AddFilePolicyExplain">This policy setting controls which types of attachments (determined by file extension) Outlook prevents from being delivered.

Digital certificates contain an attribute that shows where the corresponding CRL is located. CRLs contain lists of digital certificates that have been revoked by their controlling certification authorities (CAs), typically because the certificates were issued improperly or their associated private keys were compromised. If a CRL is missing or unavailable, Outlook cannot determine whether a certificate has been revoked. Therefore, an improperly issued certificate or one that has been compromised might be used to gain access to data. 

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose between two options that determine how Outlook functions when a CRL is missing:

If a user chooses to click the recommendation, they will be taken to the Microsoft Outlook extension page where they can choose to install this web-based, productivity add on. Your users can dismiss the recommendation and will only see the recommendation twice. If your users choose to install the extension, they will be able to access their mail, calendar, contacts, and tasks from an icon in Microsoft Edge without requiring that they open another browser tab. The extension is a “mini” version of Outlook on the web which operates as a one-click flyout from the browser header.

In the future, Microsoft may release a version of this extension for the Chrome browser. Microsoft will respect this policy for future promotions of a Chrome extension, as well.

If you enable or do not configure this policy setting, the recommendation will be presented to the user.

If you disable this policy setting, the recommendation will not be presented to the user.

Note: This policy setting only applies to subscription versions of Office, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and Outlook web app.

Customize whether immediate email sending is allowed, sending is permitted after a specific wait time, or complete evaluation is required before sending. Regardless of the setting, the service will continue the evaluation in the background and take appropriate action based on the results, such as blocking delivery if necessary.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, emails will be sent right away without waiting for the final evaluation of the configured policies.

If you enable this policy setting, you can set a specific wait time, measured in seconds (in the range of 0-9999), before the "Send Anyway" button appears in the waiting dialog. This allows users to send the mail even before the policy evaluation is complete. 

Please note that setting the wait time above 9999 indicates that users are not allowed to send the mail without evaluation. In such cases, the "Send Anyway" button will never be shown.</string><string id="L_HideNewOutlookToggle">Hide the “Try the new Outlook” toggle in Outlook</string><string id="L_HideNewOutlookToggleExplain">This policy setting controls whether the “Try the new Outlook” toggle is displayed in Outlook.

If you enable this policy setting, you can configure the maximum limit for the size of the stored certificate, up to a maximum of 16384 kb. This helps to avoid issues where a reply to a digitally signed email may not be delivered or saved in the sent items due to large certificate sizes of the original sender.

By disabling this policy setting, the maximum limit will be the default set at 12921 kb, limiting the ability of administrators to adjust the maximum size of the stored certificate.

If you do not set the policy setting, it is treated as enabled and the default maximum limit for the size of the stored certificate is set at 12921 kb.

If you enable this policy setting, Outlook will automatically display Loop components in emails. This applies to all messages or specifically to messages that originate within the recipient's local tenant or organization. This might involve contacting servers used by the installed apps to retrieve Loop components.

If you disable this policy setting, Outlook will not load content from external servers automatically, unless the sender is included in the Safe Senders list. Recipients will have the option to manually load Loop components from untrusted senders on a message-by-message basis. 

If you do not set this policy setting, Outlook will default to the “enabled" setting.

Note: Loop components included in messages located in the Junk Mail folder will not load automatically, regardless of the policy setting specified. Loop components will only be shown for apps that are installed, ensuring security and a tailored experience in Outlook.</string><string id="L_DoNewOutlookAutoMigration">Admin-Controlled Migration to New Outlook</string><string id="L_DoNewOutlookAutoMigrationExplain">
This policy controls the ability of IT admins to initiate the migration of users from classic Outlook to new Outlook.

If you enable this policy setting, IT admins will start the process to switch users from classic Outlook to new Outlook.

If you do not set this policy setting, the migration process to new Outlook will not start, and users that have not migrated will remain on classic Outlook.

Note: IT admins can also define intervals for re-initiating the migration process for users who revert to classic Outlook from new Outlook. This is managed through the NewOutlookAutoMigrationRetryIntervals policy, offering a tailored strategy for transitioning users based on organizational requirements and user feedback.

If you set this to 1, classic Outlook will show a blocking prompt on each app launch, which will attempt to switch the user to the new Outlook app.

If you set this to N (2 - 9900) value, "New Outlook auto migration" will be re-initiated N days after the user toggles back to classic Outlook.
